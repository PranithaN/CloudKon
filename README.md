# CloudKon
• Implemented a distributed task execution framework, where EC2 instances programmed in JAVA are used as Scheduler, Worker and Clients. • Programmed the Client instance that sends task to the Scheduler using Socket. • Designed a Scheduler, which uses SQS services to send Tasks to the Workers. The number of workers changed dynamically with incoming load from clients. • Observed and monitored the remote instances for the completion of task and sending back notifications. • Amazon SQS and Dynamo DB were employed in conjunction as a lookup table and handle the queue of requests to load balance across multiple workers. • Tested, Analyzed and Evaluated performance of different AWS services using various test cases.
